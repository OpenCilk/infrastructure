Welcome to OpenCilk.

This beta version is meant for experienced Cilk users running Linux or
FreeBSD on modern 64 bit x86 chips (Haswell, Excavator, or newer).
The compiler is based on LLVM 10 and supports the usual clang options.

For most purposes the Cilk features are compatible with Intel's last release
of Cilk Plus.

Use the -fopencilk command line argument and include <cilk/cilk.h> to
enable the cilk_spawn, cilk_sync, and cilk_for keywords.  Both C and
C++ are supported Reducers are supported using hyperobject headers
from Intel Cilk Plus, except it is not valid to reference the view of
a C reducer after calling CILK_C_UNREGISTER_REDUCER.

If -fopencilk is used when linking a static copy of the OpenCilk
runtime from the compiler install directory is used.  To substitute
your own runtime link without -fopencilk.
