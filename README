Welcome to OpenCilk.

This prerelease version is meant for experienced Cilk users running
Linux or FreeBSD on modern 64 bit x86 chips (Haswell, Excavator, or
newer).  The compiler is based on LLVM 9 and supports the usual clang
options.  Use the -fopencilk command line argument and include
<cilk/cilk.h> to enable the cilk_spawn, cilk_sync, and cilk_for
keywords.  Both C and C++ are supported.  Exceptions do not work yet
with Cilk code.  Exceptions must not be allowed to escape a spawned
function or a block containing an explicit or implicit sync.  Support
for exceptions is planned for OpenCilk beta in summer of 2020.
Reducers are supported using hyperobject headers from Intel Cilk Plus,
except it is not valid to reference the view of a C reducer after
calling CILK_C_UNREGISTER_REDUCER.

If -fopencilk is used when linking a static copy of the OpenCilk
runtime from the compiler install directory is used.  To substitute
your own runtime link without -fopencilk.
