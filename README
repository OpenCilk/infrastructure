Welcome to OpenCilk.

This beta version is meant for experienced Cilk users running
Unix/Linux on modern x86_64 processors (e.g., Haswell, Excavator,
or newer).  This version has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04, FreeBSD 12.1,
Fedora 30, and Mac OS X 10.15.

Here is a summary of features in this version of OpenCilk:
* The cilk_spawn, cilk_sync, and cilk_for keywords are enabled by using
  the -fopencilk command-line argument and including <cilk/cilk.h>.
* The compiler is based on LLVM 9 and supports the usual clang options.
* Both C and C++ are supported.
* Prototype support for C++ exceptions is included.
* Reducer hyperobjects are supported using the Intel Cilk Plus
  reducer library -- i.e., the hyperobject headers from Intel Cilk Plus 
  -- except that it is not valid to reference the view of a C reducer
  after calling CILK_C_UNREGISTER_REDUCER.
